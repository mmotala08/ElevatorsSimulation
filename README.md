# Elevator Simulation Application

## Overview

The Elevator Simulation Application is a console-based program designed to simulate the movement and management of elevators within a large building. The application adheres to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, ensuring modularity and maintainability while providing an interactive experience for users.

## Features

1. **Real-Time Elevator Status**: Displays the current status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction of movement, and the number of passengers it is carrying.
  
2. **Interactive Elevator Control**: Users can call an elevator to a specific floor and indicate the number of passengers waiting on each floor.
  
3. **Multiple Floors and Elevators Support**: Designed to accommodate buildings with multiple floors and elevators, allowing efficient movement between them.
  
4. **Efficient Elevator Dispatching**: Implements an algorithm to direct the nearest available elevator to respond to requests, minimizing wait times for passengers.
  
5. **Passenger Limit Handling**: Considers the maximum passenger limit for each elevator, preventing overload scenarios.
  
6. **Different Elevator Types**: Future extensions can accommodate various elevator types, including high-speed and freight elevators.
  
7. **Real-Time Operation**: The application operates in real-time, providing immediate responses to user interactions.
